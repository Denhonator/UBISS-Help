# UBISS-Help

Project by Elmeri Uotila, Andreas Casparsen, Van Phuc Bui for UBICOMP Summer School 2023 Workshop A at University of Oulu.
It is a VR application made in Unreal Engine 5.2 where the user gets to help 3 different NPCs that are experiencing common problems that occur in day-to-day life:

1. Something dropped off the table and they would appreciate if you pick it up
2. Someone is not feeling well and they would appreciate a helping hand to get them up
3. The door is closed but someone carrying a box in 2 hands is trying to get through, and they would appreciate someone opening the door

The purpose is to give the user the experience of helping other people in VR such that it would hopefully translate to being more active in helping people in real life.
